<h2>Background</h2>


<p>Welcome to www.Ace-Tennis the world's <em>largest collection of tennis drills</em> that can be veiwed online and printed of in diagram form.

Our founder is Mubsa Jumbo. Jorge is one of only ten people world-wide that has earned the Master Professional distinction with both the <strong>PTR and the USPTA </strong>. In Jorge's 33 years of teaching tennis, he has taught more than 60,000 hours of drills on the court and always loved having new and fresh tennis drills to share with his players so practices would get become boring or stale.

But Mubsa had a problem... He was not able to find a place for new tennis drills anywhere he looked. This is a problem because most tennis coaches have forgotten more drills than they can remember. It was easy to find some sites that had quality videos, and others that had only diagrams, but those were difficult to follow...

So... in 2008, Mubsa started tennisdrills.tv with the goal of making every tennis coach look like a Rock Star to their students by supplying them with an endless supply of awesome tennis drills to use in practices.

Now we have grown and have subscribers in more than 72 countries and Mubsa has been invited to speak to coaches all over the world including including, the PTR International Tennis Symposium, the USPTA World Conference on Tennis, the USTA’s Tennis Teachers Conference at the US Open in New York, the PTR Asia Tennis Symposium in Shanghai China, and the ITF worldwide coaches conference in Cancun Mexico, the Norwegian Tennis Conference in Oslo Norway, the Tennis Canada coaches road tour throughout Canada, the PTR Wimbledon coaches conference in London, and many regional and national conferences around the US. Mubsa is also a member of the “USTA National Tennis Center Professional Advisory Staff” at the US Open.

<h3>Mubsa Jumbo</h3>


<p>You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
